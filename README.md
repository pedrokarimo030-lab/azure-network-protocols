# Azure-Network-Protocols

Azure Compute and Networking: Performing Network Activities.

This project starts by creating an Azure Resource Group, followed by the deployment of two virtual machines: a Windows 10/11 VM and a Linux VM. I create a new Virtual Network (VNet) with a single subnet and place both virtual machines within this network to ensure they operate on the same IP address space and can communicate directly. 

This fig. 1 is the Resource Group

Fig. 2 shows the process of creating a Windows 11 VM and the point of deployment.

Creating a Linux (LX) VM is largely similar to creating a Windows VM; however, there are a few key differences. These include selecting a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu and configuring Linux-specific options during setup. Despite these differences, the overall deployment process remains straightforward, and successfully creating both VMs provides valuable hands-on experience with cross-platform system administration in a cloud environment.
