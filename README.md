# Azure Compute and Networking: Performing Network Activities

## 📌 Objective

This lab focuses on designing and deploying a basic Azure networking environment.  
A Virtual Network (VNet) with a single subnet was created, and both a Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux virtual machine were deployed within the same IP address space to enable private communication.

The lab also analyzes network traffic behavior using Wireshark and demonstrates how Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) control and filter traffic within the virtual network.
