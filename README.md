# Azure-Network-Protocols

Azure Compute and Networking: Performing Activities on the Network.

This project starts by creating an Azure Resource Group, followed by the deployment of two virtual machines: a Windows 10/11 VM and a Linux VM. I create a new Virtual Network (VNet) with a single subnet and place both virtual machines within this network to ensure they operate on the same IP address space and can communicate directly. 

This fig. 1 is the Resource Group
